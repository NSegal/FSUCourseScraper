        "description": "This course introduces practicum experiences in school, community, or clinical settings. These work experiences are supervised by on-site personnel (i.e. art therapists, special educators, psychologists, counselors) and by university faculty with ATR-BC credentials. Supervision, equivalent to ten hours for every one hundred hours of field work, is integral to this practicum. Supervision sessions include discussion of assessment and implementation of client programs and progress, directed reading relevant to site participation, and professional development of the student art therapist.",
