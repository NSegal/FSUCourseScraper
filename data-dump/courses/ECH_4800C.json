        "description": "This course involves the production of a distilled-spirit sample at a commercial facility, followed by an in-depth chemical analysis of the product through the use of sophisticated instrumentation located at a university chemistry laboratory in Scotland. This intensive course takes place over a two-week period in which students are instructed in the operational procedure of the plant and given hands-on involvement in an actual production run. Lecture and laboratory sessions following the production run focus on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of the distilled spirit sample using spectroscopic, chromatographic, and NMR techniques.",
