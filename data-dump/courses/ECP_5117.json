Analysis including stable population theory and indirect estimation, continuous and discrete time formulations are considered; generalizations of the standard model with fixed mortality and fertility are also examined. Parametric models of fertility, mortality, stable populations, and the curve-fitting techniques underlying these approaches are reviewed.",
