        "description": "This course enables students to work on a writing project throughout the semester (e.g., journal article, fellowship proposal, or prospectus). Students identify the audience and purpose of their writing project and then clarify the central idea of their article or proposal. From there, they draft their work section by section, figure by figure, and then peer review their sections and figures in small groups. Central to the course is the idea that writing and thinking go hand in had and that it is only through careful revision (at least for most), including careful consideration of peer feedback, that we are able to produce a finished paper or proposal that is clear and cogent enough to be published or funded.",
