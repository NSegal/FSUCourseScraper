        "description": "This course presents techniques for the analysis and simulation of nanometric-scale semiconductor devices (SDs), and focuses on the analysis of quantum-induced effects on the electronic transport and characteristics of SDs. The course covers generation-recombination processes in semiconductors, quantum and semiclassical modeling of SDs, noise and fluctuations in SDs, and numerical techniques for the simulation of SDs.",
