        "description": "This course examines the theory of transport phenomena from a molecular viewpoint. Classical concepts from statistical mechanics and derivation of the Boltzmann equation. The transport theory and properties of dilute gases are developed from the Boltzmann equation, with a more general treatment given for the case of liquids. A brief introduction to time correlation functions is presented.",
