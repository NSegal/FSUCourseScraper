        "description": "This course is a skills-development course that covers the process of designing and building mechanical effects for the stage. Areas to be studied include basic physics, hydraulics and pneumatics, electro-mechanics, and control systems, as well as a systematic approach to machinery design. This study leads to the public presentation of a fully realized, practical final project.",
