Students read, discuss, and write about texts by, typically, George Orwell, Albert Camus, Susan Sontag, Camille Paglia, Greil Marcus, and Cornell West, in order to: (1) Encounter ideas to which they have not yet been exposed, (2) Become aware of their own heightened ability to work with big ideas and communicate them, and (3) Identify a road map for their own progress toward becoming a public intellectual.",
