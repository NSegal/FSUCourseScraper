        "description": "This course examines the history of terrorism as both an idea and a political strategy, with particular focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It emphasizes the need for understanding terrorism and related forms of political violence within a systemic framework that takes into account the roles of anti-terrorist policies, police activities, and political debate in shaping not only the public perception of terrorism but also the self-perception of those who would adopt it as a tactic.",
