        "description": "This course focuses on the relationships between politics in the US and internationally and the media. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of political communication, a field at the intersection of sociology, psychology, rhetoric, political science, and media effects, the overarching methodological approach may encompass qualitative and/or quantitative emphases.
