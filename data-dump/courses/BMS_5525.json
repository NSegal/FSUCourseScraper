        "description": "This course is an advanced, lecture-based course emphasizing the molecular basis of regulation in biological systems. An important component is the study of the design and interpretation of experiments leading to understanding of regulation of gene expression. The course relies on contemporary research literature and focuses on specific model organisms and current problems that illustrate experimental approaches used to investigate different aspects of the control of gene expression.",
