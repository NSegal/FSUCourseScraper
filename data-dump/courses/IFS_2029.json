        "description": "This course poses the question: How can we understand and respond to urban decay and decline? Using examples from the U.S. and abroad, students explore the differences between \"conventional\" urban poverty (which may be a necessary part of successful cities), systematic urban decline, new suburban poverty, favelas and shantytowns, etc. Students also examine recent strategies to \"reclaim\" failing cities.",
