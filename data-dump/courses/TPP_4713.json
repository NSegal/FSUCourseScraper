The International Phonetic Alphabet is introduced in an organic manner as a primary tool in the adoption of different speech sounds from those that are natural to each student actor. This course includes a \"Speech Sound Donor Project,\" in which the student actor must study and implement a dialect different from their own natural one, and then must teach it to the group at large. May be repeated to a maximum of six semester hours.",
