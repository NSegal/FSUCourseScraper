        "description": "This course examines the concept of race from the perspectives of biological and cultural anthropology, beginning with the study of modern human biological variation and its clinical distribution. This biological patterning is then contrasted with the social categories of race. The final section of the course covers the history of the concept of race, the ways humans culturally construct divisions in different societies, and the continued effects of racial concepts on science and on modern cultures.",
