        "description": "This course addresses the theoretical foundations and practical techniques for the design and implementation of real-time computer systems. Topics include applicable scheduling theory, the use of computers for controlling real time processes, and the use of a real-time operating system. Laboratory work includes writing software to control a physical device with hard timing constraints and analysis of scheduling performance by simulation. A term project and report are required.",
