        "description": "This course explores organic geochemistry of natural waters and sediments. It includes an overview of the sources of organic matter in aquatic systems, the important reactions and transport mechanisms that control the biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon in these systems, and the impact of naturally-occurring organic carbon on environmental and ecological processes. Attention also devoted to anthropogenic (xenobiotic) organic molecules. Discussion of how analytical techniques such as 13C NMR, mass spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, and chromatography provide useful organic biogeochemical information.",
