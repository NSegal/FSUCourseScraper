Students analyze how filmmakers address the sociocultural dilemmas facing the individual in Turkish society (modern/traditional, eastern/western, urban/rural, religious/secular, nationalist/minority, etc.). The course also explores in detail the aesthetic vision of a sample of successful Turkish filmmakers. Taught in English, course materials in English, and all films subtitled in English.",
