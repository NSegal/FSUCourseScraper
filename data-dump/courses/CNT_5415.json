        "description": "In this course, students familiarize themselves with current and emerging threats to the security of computer systems and networks, including viruses, worms, and network intrusion; and with techniques for the prevention, detection, and recovery from such attacks, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure coding practices, and others. Attack and defense mechanisms are studied in a systematic way to develop students' practical and analytical skills to identify and correct or mitigate threats to computer systems and networks.",
