        "description": "This course uses the historical method to answer a simple question: Why do Americans and Floridians remember Osceola as the leader of Seminole resistance rather than any of the other more prominent, powerful, and successful leaders from the three Seminole Wars? In addition to introducing new historical approaches to Native American history, this course also asks how historical truths and myths are created, sustained, and ultimately embraced. In the process, the course facilitates critical engagement with the living legacies of Indian Removal.",
