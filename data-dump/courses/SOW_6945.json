        "description": "This two-part course is designed for students to engage in supervised research. This course helps students move from having a substantive area to developing a research agenda, planning, and executing their own work. Students are encouraged to select a topic relevant to their own substantive area of interest. In the first semester, students develop a working relationship with an individual faculty member; simultaneously students attend a seminar in which they propose a project, prepare a work plan, and prepare an IRB application. In the second semester, the individual faculty member supervises the students' implementation and write-up of the research project.",
