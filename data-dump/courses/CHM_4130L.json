        "description": "This course is the laboratory portion of CHM 4130, Advanced Analytical Chemistry. Experiments include: signal enhancement by filtering and ensemble averaging, flame spectroscopy determination of Li and Mg, spectroflurometric determination of quinine, UV-visible spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) simulations, Raman spectroscopy, solvent extraction and gas chromatography, as well as HPLC determination of analgesics. It is recommended that students complete CHM 4130 with a grade of \"C\u2013\" or better before taking CHM 4130L, although the courses can be taken simultaneously.",
